This is a version of the AutoHotkey script, AutoCorrect.ahk.  It is written in AHK v2 code, and so is "AutoCorrect2.ahk."  Please note that the file, "AutoCorrect2.exe" is not a compiled version of the .ahk file.  Rather, it is a copy of AutoHotKey.exe that I got from the AutoHotkey site, and renamed, to match the .ahk file.  Keeping the two in the same folder allows a person to run the code "portably," right from the folder.  The ManualCorrectionLogger ahk and exe files work similarly.  Neither the AutoCorrect.ahk, nor the ManualCorrectionLogger.ahk files, should ever be compiled, otherwise, they won't be ale to append new autocorrect hotstrings to themselves.
